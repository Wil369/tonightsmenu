        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Tonight's Menu</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <p class="effective">Effective Date: February 19, 2026</p>

        <p>Tonight's Menu ("we," "our," or "the App") is developed and operated by Market Soleil L.L.C. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use the Tonight's Menu iOS application.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p><strong>Camera and Photo Data:</strong> When you use the fridge scanning feature, the App accesses your device camera or photo library to capture images of your ingredients. These images are sent to a third-party AI service (OpenAI) for ingredient detection and are not stored on our servers. Images are processed in real time and are not retained after analysis is complete.</p>
        <p><strong>Subscription and Purchase Data:</strong> If you subscribe to Tonight's Menu Premium, your purchase is processed by Apple through the App Store. We use RevenueCat, a third-party service, to manage subscription status. We do not have access to your payment information such as credit card numbers. RevenueCat may collect an anonymous app user ID to manage your subscription.</p>
        <p><strong>Locally Stored Data:</strong> Your saved recipes, meal plans, shopping lists, ratings, and preferences are stored locally on your device. This data is not transmitted to our servers.</p>
        <p><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We do not collect analytics, crash reports, or usage tracking data.</p>

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information described above solely to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide AI-powered ingredient detection from your fridge photos</li>
            <li>Suggest recipes based on detected ingredients</li>
            <li>Manage your premium subscription status</li>
            <li>Store your preferences, meal plans, and shopping lists on your device</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App uses the following third-party services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>OpenAI API:</strong> Used to analyze fridge images and identify ingredients. Images are sent securely to OpenAI for processing. Please refer to <a href="https://openai.com/privacy" target="_blank">OpenAI's Privacy Policy</a> for more information on how they handle data.</li>
            <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> Used to manage in-app subscriptions. Please refer to <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank">RevenueCat's Privacy Policy</a> for more information.</li>
            <li><strong>Apple App Store:</strong> Handles all payment processing for subscriptions. Please refer to <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank">Apple's Privacy Policy</a> for more information.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or share your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes. Data is only shared with the third-party services listed above as necessary to provide the App's core functionality.</p>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>Fridge images sent for AI analysis are processed in real time and are not stored by us. Locally stored data (recipes, meal plans, shopping lists) remains on your device until you delete it or uninstall the App.</p>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your information. All data transmitted to third-party services is sent over encrypted HTTPS connections. Locally stored data is protected by your device's built-in security features.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Tonight's Menu is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.</p>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Since your data is stored locally on your device, you have full control over it at all times. You can delete your saved recipes, meal plans, and shopping lists within the App. Uninstalling the App will remove all locally stored data.</p>
